# Eating-Activity-Detection

Only some files are included here due to file size.

In this project, a system was developed for detecting the eating patterns of a person using accelerometer signals from a Microbit, a pocket-sized embedded system, worn on their dominant hand. The system recognizes eating activity using a personalized random forest classifier trained on the user's data. The user can record new eating periods on the app in order to make their model better at identifying their eating movements.

The project uses multiple AWS services to facilitate this, including Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, and AWS Amplify.
